# burger
Burger App is a node applications that allows the user to create their own burger thats gets added to a list of other burgers.
The user can then continue to add / create more burgers while choosing when to devour any existing burger which at that point, removed the burger from the list.

#Looking over my code, I believe I have the majority of it down but I do have some errors still happening. 

When the app first opens up, you will see an image of a burger with two lists on either side. Once which has preset burgers already listed and the other which will show an empty list where devoured burgers will go.

I have all the wording and buttons to allow the user to submit their burger here.

A bug I am having issues with is on the devoured list. When the user wants to add a burger and chooses the devoured button, the button submits the burger but it does not currently show listed.

In the terminal, if the user clicks on either button, devoured, remove, add burger, It will show the list of burgers currently in the presets. It should be updating with the correct burgers listed on either side.
